#When dividing any two integers, it will always result in a float datatype even if it is a whole number
#Underscore Behavior in code
Universe_Age = 14_000_000_000 #Underscores are hidden when code is ran
print(Universe_Age)
#Multiple Variable Assignment to allow for cleaner code
x, y, z = 15,30,50
print(x, y, z)
#For Constant values that never change, ALWAYS NAME IN ALL CAPS
MAX_CONNECTION = 50000

#Book Practice
#2-9 Use all operations to produce the answer of 8 just using the print function
print(5+3)
